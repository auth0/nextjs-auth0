## Getting Started

### 1. Install the SDK

```shell
npm i @auth0/nextjs-auth0
```

This library requires Node.js 20 LTS and newer LTS versions.

### 2. Add the environment variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```
AUTH0_DOMAIN=
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
AUTH0_SECRET=
APP_BASE_URL=
```

The `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` can be obtained from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) once you've created an application. **This application must be a `Regular Web Application`**.

The `AUTH0_SECRET` is the key used to encrypt the session and transaction cookies. You can generate a secret using `openssl`:

```shell
openssl rand -hex 32
```

The `APP_BASE_URL` is the URL that your application is running on. When developing locally, this is most commonly `http://localhost:3000`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to register the follwing URLs in your Auth0 Application via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com):
>
> - Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to the list of **Allowed Callback URLs**
> - Add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of **Allowed Logout URLs**

### 3. Create the Auth0 SDK client

Create an instance of the Auth0 client. This instance will be imported and used in anywhere we need access to the authentication methods on the server.

Add the following contents to a file named `lib/auth0.ts`:

```ts
import { Auth0Client } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0/server"

export const auth0 = new Auth0Client()
```

### 4. Add the authentication middleware

Create a `middleware.ts` file in the root of your project's directory:

```ts
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server"

import { auth0 } from "./lib/auth0"

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return await auth0.middleware(request)
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico, sitemap.xml, robots.txt (metadata files)
     */
    "/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)",
  ],
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using a `src/` directory, the `middleware.ts` file must be created inside the `src/` directory.

You can now begin to authenticate your users by redirecting them to your application's `/auth/login` route:

```tsx
import { auth0 } from "@/lib/auth0"

export default async function Home() {
  const session = await auth0.getSession()

  if (!session) {
    return (
      <main>
        <a href="/auth/login?screen_hint=signup">Sign up</a>
        <a href="/auth/login">Log in</a>
      </main>
    )
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome, {session.user.name}!</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use `<a>` tags instead of the `<Link>` component to ensure that the routing is not done client-side as that may result in some unexpected behavior.

## Customizing the client

You can customize the client by using the options below:

| Option                      | Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Routes

The SDK mounts 6 routes:

1. `/auth/login`: the login route that the user will be redirected to to start a initiate an authentication transaction
2. `/auth/logout`: the logout route that must be addedto your Auth0 application's Allowed Logout URLs
3. `/auth/callback`: the callback route that must be addedto your Auth0 application's Allowed Callback URLs
4. `/auth/profile`: the route to check the user's session and return their attributes
5. `/auth/access-token`: the route to check the user's session and return an access token (which will be automatically refreshed if a refresh token is available)
6. `/auth/backchannel-logout`: the route that will receive a `logout_token` when a configured Back-Channel Logout initiator occurs
