## 1. Why do I get a `checks.state argument is missing` error if I try to log in from different tabs?

Every time you initiate login, the SDK stores in cookies some transient state (`nonce`, `state`, `code_verifier`) necessary to verify the callback request from Auth0. Initiating login concurrently from different tabs will result in that state being overwritten in each subsequent tab. Once the login is completed in some tab, the SDK will compare the state in the callback with the state stored in the cookies. As the cookies were overwritten, the values will not match (except for the tab that initiated login the last) and the SDK will return the `checks.state argument is missing` error.

Eg:

1. Open Tab 1 to login: stores some state in cookies.
2. Open Tab 2 to login: stores its own state overwritting Tab 1 state.
3. Complete login on Tab 1: SDK finds Tab 2 state on the cookies and returns error.

**You should handle the error and prompt the user to login again.** As they will have an active SSO session, they will not be asked to enter their credentials again and will be redirected back to your application.

## 2. How can I reduce the cookie size?

The SDK stores the session data in cookies. Since browsers reject cookies larger than 4 KB, the SDK breaks up lengthier sessions into multiple cookies. However, by default Node.js [limits the header size](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/#denial-of-service-with-large-http-headers-cve-2018-12121) to 8 KB.

If the session cookies are pushing the header size over the limit, **you have two options**:

-  Use `-max-http-header-size` to increase Node's header size.
-  Remove unused data from the session cookies.

For the latter, you can add an `afterCallback` hook to remove the ID Token and/or unused claims from the user profile:

```js
// pages/api/auth/[...auth0].js
import { handleAuth, handleCallback } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

const afterCallback = (req, res, session, state) => {
  delete session.idToken; // This gets persisted by the SDK
  return session;
};

export handleAuth({
  async callback(req, res) {
    try {
      await handleCallback(req, res, { afterCallback });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(error.status || 500).end(error.message);
    }
  }
});
```

> Note: support for custom session stores [is in our roadmap](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/issues/279).
