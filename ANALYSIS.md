# Analysis of Issue: `getSession(req)` fails in middleware

## Issue Summary
The reported issue claims that `req instanceof NextRequest` returns `false` in Next.js middleware because the request object is allegedly a `NextRequestHint` that doesn't inherit from `NextRequest`.

## Evidence Against the Issue

### 1. Maintainer Could Not Reproduce
@frederikprijck tested extensively and could NOT reproduce the issue with:
- Next.js 15.4.5
- Next.js 15.4.2-canary.26 (exact version reported in issue)
- Both default runtime and `runtime: 'nodejs'`
- Result: `instanceof NextRequest` worked correctly in all cases

### 2. Next.js Source Code Verification
The maintainer verified in Next.js source that `NextRequestHint` actually **DOES** extend `NextRequest`:
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/0985b2318645f1f7c267624388279528d8d44695/packages/next/src/server/web/adapter.ts#L39

### 3. Issue Status
- Closed due to inability to reproduce
- No reproduction case provided by reporter
- No response from reporter after maintainer's request for more context

## Current Code Analysis

The current implementation uses `instanceof` checks at three locations in `src/server/client.ts`:

1. Line 533 (getSession):
```typescript
if (req instanceof NextRequest) {
    return this.sessionStore.get(req.cookies);
}
```

2. Line 895 (updateSession):
```typescript
if (req instanceof NextRequest && res instanceof NextResponse) {
    // middleware usage
}
```

3. Line 1099 (saveToSession):
```typescript
if (req instanceof NextRequest && res instanceof NextResponse) {
    // middleware usage
}
```

## Conclusion

**This appears to be a false report or a non-issue because:**

1. The maintainer thoroughly tested and could not reproduce
2. The Next.js source code shows the inheritance is correct
3. No reproduction case was ever provided
4. The issue was closed as unable to reproduce

**Recommendation**: 
- No changes needed unless user provides a valid reproduction case
- Current `instanceof` checks are working as intended
- Making changes for a non-reproducible issue risks introducing bugs

## Potential "Defensive" Approach (NOT RECOMMENDED)

If absolutely necessary to be more defensive (though not justified by evidence), could use duck typing:

```typescript
function isNextRequest(req: any): boolean {
    return req && 
           typeof req === 'object' && 
           'cookies' in req && 
           'nextUrl' in req &&
           typeof req.cookies === 'object';
}
```

However, this:
- Solves a problem that doesn't exist
- Is less type-safe
- Could match objects that aren't actually NextRequest
- Adds unnecessary complexity
